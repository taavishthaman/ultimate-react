How to create components:
    Components should be neither too large and nor too small. One component should not have too many responsibilities.
    A component should not have very complex JSX or too many props.

    4 criterias to create components are:
    1. Logical separation of content.
    2. Reusability.
    3. Responsibilities and Complexity.
    4. Personal Coding style.

Components naturally fall in 3 categories

    1. Stateless/Presentational Components : Do not have their own states. Can have props. Only used for presenting data.
    2. Stateful Components : Have state and can be reusable.
    3. Structural Components : Pages, layouts or screens of app. Can be huge and resusable.

Prop Drilling:
    Prop drilling is when you require some data in a very deeply nested component and you have to pass that data
    throught props in all its ancestor components.

Component Composition:
    Combining different components using the children prop (or explicitly defined props).
    With component composition we can:
    1. Create highly reusable and flexible components.
    2. Fix prop drilling.
