Tailwind is mobile first since it uses min-width internally. So the default classes are for mobile.

React Query.
    Fetches and caches data, so do not need to fetch again and again. Also keeps apps in synch with server.

React Patterns:

1. Render Props Pattern : The render props pattern passes in a prop called render which is a function which explains what to render
    and how to render it. Essentially the callbakc function used inside a map function to render a list, pass that callback function
    to the component as a render prop and use that function inside the map function.

2. Higher order components Pattren : A higher order component is a component which takes in another component as a prop and returns an
    enhanced or a better version of that component.

3. Compound Component Pattern: Compound components are a set of related components which together achieve a common and a useful task.
    Used in modal windows, pagination, tables etc. Its used without passing in props to the component which can cause prop explosion
    like most of these npm packages with 5 million props. Internally it uses Context and micro components attached as functions to the
    parent component.


React Portal: React Portal is a feature that allows us to render an element outside the parent component's DOM structure while still
    keeping the element in the original position in the component tree. Used for Modal Windows, Tooltips, Menus etc. This is done
    for the sake of reusability because what if a modal is used in a page which has overflow hidden property set. Then the modal will
    be cut off. Rendering it like this makes sure it operates on the high level of DOM tree and dosen't get affected by CSS.
